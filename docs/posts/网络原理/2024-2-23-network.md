## Data Info
Data is a collection of values, symbols, or characters that 
represents information
### Two kinds of data
- Qualitative data (Non-numerical data) 定类数据
- Quantitative data 定量数据
  - Discrete data
    - Binary data 
  - Limited values(finite values)
  - Continuous data[^1]

[^1]: This means Any value in a certain range AND it is a unlimited values, infinite values 

## Communication
### Message
the information (data) to be communicated(text, numbers, pictures, audio, and video,...)
### Sender
the device that sends the data message(a computer, workstation, telephone handset,video camera, and so on)
### Receiver
the device that receives the message.
### Transmission medium
the physical path by which a message travels from sender to receiver.
(twisted-pair wire, coaxial cable, fiber-optic cable, and radio waves)

### Protocol
a set of rules that govern data communications
:::success expample
Without a protocol, two devices may be connected but not communicating, just as a person speaking French cannot be understood by a person who speaks only Japanese.

## network protocol
### Info
:::tip
A protocol is an agreement between the communicating parties on how communication is to proceed
:::

- Communication node is machine
- All communication is controlled by protocols 
- Protocols define formats, order of sending and receiving of messages, and the actions that the reception initiates

:::warning For example -HTTP
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) specifies rules by which the client and the server interact so as to retrieve a document.
The protocol assumes the client and the server can exchange messages directly.
The client software needs to set up a two-way connection prior to the HTTP request.

## Elements of a Protocol

### Syntax
- Structure or format of the data
- Indicates how to read the bits - field delineation
### Semantics
- Interprets the meaning of the bits
- Knows which fields define what action
### Timing
- When data should be sent
- Speed at which data should be sent or speed at which it is being received.
